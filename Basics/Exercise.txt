The Terminal is an interface that allows access to the command lin. It allows us
 to edit,close and open folders and files. It is terrible and that is why GUI's
are important. Github is a software platform that coders use to store read and e
dit there code. In my words git is an extension of github added onto the termina
l of a computer to receive and send changes or edits in a project. We use github
 because rocks. It allows us to work together in a project from different areas
in the world.
